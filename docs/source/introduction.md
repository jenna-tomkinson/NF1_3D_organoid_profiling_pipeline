# Overview

The NF1 3D Organoid Profiling Pipeline is a comprehensive computational framework for processing, segmenting, and analyzing three-dimensional microscopy imaging data from patient-derived organoids. This pipeline was developed to support high-throughput drug screening and characterization studies of NF1-related conditions.

# Key Features

- **3D Image Processing**: Full support for volumetric microscopy data
- **Automated Segmentation**: Deep learning-based nuclei and organoid segmentation
- **Feature Extraction**: 150+ morphological and intensity-based features
- **High-Throughput**: Scalable processing on HPC clusters (SLURM)
- **Quality Control**: Comprehensive image QC and filtering

# Applications

- **Drug Screening**: Identify compounds affecting organoid morphology
- **Disease Modeling**: Compare morphological signatures across patient genotypes
- **Mechanistic Studies**: Relate phenotypes to specific organelles
- **Biomarker Discovery**: Identify predictive features of treatment response
