# Area.Size.Shape Features

## Description

Area.Size.Shape features characterize the geometric properties and spatial extent of segmented objects. These measurements are computed using both mesh and voxel-based approaches.

## Features Extracted

### Area.Size.Shape Feature Measurements

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| VOLUME | Total volume of the segmented object in voxels |
| CENTER.X | X-coordinate of object centroid |
| CENTER.Y | Y-coordinate of object centroid |
| CENTER.Z | Z-coordinate of object centroid |
| BBOX.VOLUME | Volume of the bounding box containing the object |
| MIN.X / MAX.X | Minimum and maximum X coordinates |
| MIN.Y / MAX.Y | Minimum and maximum Y coordinates |
| MIN.Z / MAX.Z | Minimum and maximum Z coordinates |
| EXTENT | Ratio of object volume to bounding box volume |
| EULER.NUMBER | Euler characteristic (topological descriptor) |
| EQUIVALENT.DIAMETER | Diameter of a sphere with equivalent volume |
| SURFACE.AREA | Total surface area of the 3D object |

## Calculation Method

These features use 3D mesh reconstruction and voxel analysis:

1. **Mesh Generation**: Create 3D surface mesh from voxel boundaries
2. **Volume Calculation**: Sum voxels within segmented region
3. **Surface Analysis**: Compute surface area from mesh triangulation
4. **Spatial Statistics**: Calculate centroid and bounding box properties

## Applications

Area.Size.Shape features are useful for:

* Quantifying cell and organoid growth
* Detecting morphological abnormalities
* Comparing size distributions across conditions
* Identifying fusion or fragmentation events
