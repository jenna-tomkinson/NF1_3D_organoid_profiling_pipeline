# Colocalization Features

## Description

Colocalization features quantify the degree to which two different spectral channels spatially co-occur within a segmented object. These measurements assess the relationship and correlation between different protein markers.

## Overview

Colocalization features are computed for each unique pair of channels within the same segmented object.
