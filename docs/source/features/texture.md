# Texture Features

## Description

Texture features quantify spatial patterns and local intensity variations within segmented objects. These features are computed from the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM).

## Calculation Method

Texture features are derived from the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), which captures the frequency of intensity pair relationships at specified offsets.

### Parameters

* **Gray Levels**: 256 (quantization of intensity values)
* **Offset**: 1 voxel (distance for co-occurrence pairs)

These parameters can be adjusted to capture texture patterns at different scales.

### Texture Feature Measurements

| Feature | Description | Range | Low Value Indicates | High Value Indicates |
|---------|-------------|-------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Angular.Second.Moment | Textural uniformity / energy | [0, 1] | Heterogeneous, varied texture (many different patterns) | Uniform, homogeneous texture (repetitive patterns) |
| Contrast | Local variation in intensity | [0, ∞) | Smooth, low contrast (blurred edges, gradual transitions) | Sharp edges, high contrast (crisp boundaries, distinct structures) |
| Correlation | Linear dependency of neighboring gray levels | [-1, 1] | Uncorrelated, random texture (independent pixel intensities) | Correlated texture (organized structures, smooth gradients) |
| Variance | Spread of GLCM intensity values | [0, (255)²] | Narrow intensity range (uniform brightness) | Wide intensity range (high dynamic range) |
| Inverse.Difference.Moment | Local homogeneity | [0, 1] | Inhomogeneous (varied local intensities) | Homogeneous (similar neighboring pixels) |
| Sum.Average | Weighted mean intensity | [0, 2(255)] | Dark co-occurrence (low signal, dim staining) | Bright co-occurrence (strong signal, bright staining) |
| Sum.Variance | Variance of combined intensities | [0, ∞) | Consistent combined intensities | Wide range of intensity sums |
| Sum.Entropy | Randomness in intensity sums | [0, log₂(511)] | Ordered, predictable sum patterns | Random, disordered intensity sums |
| Entropy | Overall texture complexity | [0, log₂(65536)] | Simple, ordered texture (smooth regions, uniform areas) | Complex, random texture (highly textured, irregular patterns) |
| Difference.Variance | Variance in intensity differences | [0, (65536)] | Consistent contrast throughout | Variable local contrast (mixed smooth/textured regions) |
| Difference.Entropy | Randomness in intensity differences | [0, log₂(256)] | Smooth transitions (gradual edges) | Irregular transitions (fragmented structures, noisy edges) |
| Info.Measure.Corr.1 | Mutual information correlation 1 | [-1, 1] | Weak correlation (think random noise) | Strong nonlinear correlation (organized patterns) |
| Info.Measure.Corr.2 | Mutual information correlation 2 | [0, 1] | Low mutual information (uncorrelated texture) | High mutual information (highly organized texture) |

**Note:** 255 is used but can be replaced with Ng where: Ng represents the number of gray levels (256 in this implementation).
