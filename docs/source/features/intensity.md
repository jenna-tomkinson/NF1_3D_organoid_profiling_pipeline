# Intensity Features

## Description

Intensity features quantify the pixel/voxel value distributions within segmented objects. These measurements capture both overall intensity levels and spatial intensity patterns.

## Features Extracted

### Location-Based Intensity

## Calculation Method

Intensity features are computed as follows:

1. **Segmentation Masking**: Apply object masks to isolate pixel/voxel values
2. **Statistical Computation**: Calculate mean, median, max, min, std, etc.
3. **Spatial Analysis**: Determine intensity-weighted coordinates and gradients
4. **Edge Detection**: Identify edge pixels/voxels and compute edge statistics

## Applications

Intensity features are useful for:

* Quantifying fluorescence levels within cellular structures
* Detecting changes in protein expression
* Characterizing subcellular localization patterns
* Identifying phenotypic alterations due to treatments
