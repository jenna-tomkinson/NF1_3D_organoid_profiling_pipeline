# Neighbors Features

## Description

Neighbors features quantify spatial relationships and adjacency patterns between segmented objects within the image volume.

## Current Implementation

The neighbors feature set currently captures:

* Object-to-object proximity measurements
* Spatial adjacency statistics

## Total Features

Currently **2 neighbors features** are extracted per image set.

## Applications

Neighbors features support analysis of:

* Tissue organization and architecture
* Cell-cell interactions
* Spatial clustering patterns
* Developmental organization
