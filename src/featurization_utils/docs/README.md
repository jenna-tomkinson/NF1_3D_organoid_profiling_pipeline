| **Angular Second Moment (Energy / Uniformity)** | **0 → 1**                                   | Texture **uniformity**. Higher = more uniform/smoother.                                                                             |

| **Correlation**                                 | Theoretical **−1 → 1**, typically **0 → 1** | **Linear dependency** between pixels. Higher = more predictable neighbors.                                                          |
| **Variance**                                    | **≥ 0** (up to ((N_g-1)^2))                 | **Gray-level spread**. Larger = more intensity variation.                                                                           |
| **Inverse Difference Moment (Homogeneity)**     | **0 → 1**                                   | **Smoothness**. Higher = neighbors have similar values.                                                                             |

| **Entropy**                                     | **0 → log(N_g²)** (≈ 0 → ~8 for 8-bit)      | **Randomness/disorder**. Higher = irregular texture/noise.                                                                          |

| **Information Measure of Correlation 1 (IMC1)** | **−1 → 1**                                  | **Mutual information / independence measure**. <0 = strong dependence. Values near 1 usually **numerical artifacts**, not physical. |
| **Information Measure of Correlation 2 (IMC2)** | **0 → 1**                                   | Information-theoretic **dependency**. Higher = stronger structured correlation.                                                     |
